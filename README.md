This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming related to the limitations of the Integer type's range. The `Check_Range` function is designed to check if an input integer falls within a specific range. However, it doesn't explicitly handle potential out-of-range scenarios that can arise with unexpected user inputs. The solution illustrates a robust approach using a more flexible numeric type, such as Long_Integer, to prevent potential runtime errors. This is a good example of how seemingly minor range assumptions can result in unexpected results in Ada.
